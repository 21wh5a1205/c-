name, id, basic, DA, IT, net_salary, as data memebrs.
void get_details() and void print_details() as member functions.
3.Create a main() method.
4.Create an array of class object with (e) a specific size and i as integer.
5.Read i.
6.Call the get_details() method through the array of class object from 0 to i.
7.Call the print_details() method through the array of class object from 0 to i.
