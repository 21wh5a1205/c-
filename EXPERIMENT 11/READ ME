EXPERIMENT-11

Aim of the Experiment Write a C++ program to create multilevel inheritance. (Hint: Classes A1, A2, A3),

Step-by-step process of the Experiment:
1.Create a base class named Grand_parent and declare a instance variable (a).
2.Create a base construtor and initialize the instance variable in it.
3.Now,create a derived class parent and inherit the properties from the class Grand_parent.
4.Again,create a new derived class child and interit properties of the class parent.
5.In the Multilevel inheritance, the child class derives from a class which already derived from another class.
6.Here, the child class has derived from parent class which was already derived from Grand_parentClass.
